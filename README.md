# About Downing CSS

- First of all, I'm not sure whether the name is going to be permanent.
- Being a web developer, I've had the chance to work with many web frameworks and most of the time I write out (most) everything myself. This kind of repetition can become tiresome especially when they do the same thing over and over again, over a course of many websites you build.
- I created this simple CSS file so that I can remove some of that repetition and I can add some default custom styles for things such as `font-size` and `button` elements.

## Included in the current version

1. Resetting default styles for `margin`, `padding` and `box-sizing`. (Obviously)
2. Default font sizes for heading and paragraphs - including media queries for scaling them up.
3. Custom classes to increase font sizes for paragraphs and headings.
4. Custom button classes named `btn-red`, `btn-green`, `btn-purple`, `btn-yellow`, `btn-orange`, `btn-skyblue`, `btn-pink`

- Currently this version doesn't contain a lot except the basic styles most used in a website. I am yet to add more and more styles as I require them.

## Can I use this?

- Yes, you can use it as often and as many times you want in your projects.

## Contributing

- If you want to add something to downing, make a pull request. Only PRs that add onto this or add something interesting will be merged so as not to pollute the repository.

Thank you.
